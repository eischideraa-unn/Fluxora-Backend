# Webhooks

## Outbox dispatcher

Stream writes enqueue rows in `webhook_outbox` inside the same database transaction as the stream update. The live dispatcher in `src/webhooks/service.ts` polls that table and sends each event to the configured consumer endpoint.

Required configuration:

- `WEBHOOK_URL`: HTTPS endpoint that receives webhook `POST` requests.
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: HMAC signing secret used for `x-fluxora-signature`.
- `WEBHOOK_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`: polling interval in milliseconds. Defaults to `10000`.
- `WEBHOOK_BATCH_SIZE`: rows claimed per poll. Defaults to `10`.

The service startup path starts the dispatcher after migrations are checked. Shutdown registers the dispatcher as a drainable service, so SIGTERM/SIGINT stops future polls and waits for the in-flight batch before closing database connections.

## Delivery guarantees

The dispatcher claims rows with:

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM webhook_outbox
WHERE processed = false
  AND created_at <= NOW()
ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC
LIMIT $1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` lets multiple API instances run dispatchers concurrently without claiming the same row at the same time. A row is marked `processed = true` only after the HTTP attempt is complete. If the process exits before commit, PostgreSQL releases the lock and the row remains unprocessed for another worker to deliver, which provides at-least-once delivery.

Failed retryable deliveries are delegated to `src/webhooks/retry.ts`. The original row is marked processed and a new unprocessed row is inserted with `created_at` set to the next retry time. The dispatcher only claims rows whose `created_at` is due, so retries remain durable in PostgreSQL without holding process memory.

## Security notes

Webhook requests are signed with the configured secret and include delivery metadata headers. Production endpoints must use HTTPS unless they target loopback for local deployments. URLs with embedded credentials are rejected.

Consumers must treat webhook delivery as at-least-once: verify the signature, deduplicate by `x-fluxora-delivery-id`, and make handlers idempotent.
