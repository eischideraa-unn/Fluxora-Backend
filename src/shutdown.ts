/**
 * Graceful shutdown: drain HTTP + DB pool.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *  - All in-flight HTTP requests are allowed to complete before the process exits.
 *  - Idle keep-alive connections are closed immediately so server.close() resolves
 *    as soon as the last active request finishes.
 *  - A hard timeout prevents the process from hanging indefinitely when a request
 *    stalls or a dependency is unresponsive.
 *  - DB / external-pool teardown hooks can be registered via addShutdownHook().
 *  - Health endpoint returns 503 once shutdown begins so load balancers stop
 *    routing new traffic to this instance.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *  - Timeout exceeded  → closeAllConnections() is called and the process exits
 *    with code 1 so the orchestrator knows the shutdown was forced.
 *  - Hook throws       → error is logged; remaining hooks still execute.
 *  - Double SIGTERM    → second signal is ignored (shutdown already in progress).
